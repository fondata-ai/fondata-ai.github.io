### Dana Wang

__Dana Wang__ is an educator, a scientist, and a problem solver. She has taught students in a variety of capacities, from pre-schoolers to most recently, college students as a Management Professor at the University of Texas. She not only teaches fundamental concepts but also helps her students apply what they learn, such as resource creation in business strategy to their entrepreneurial endeavors.  

Her initial interest in basic chemistry and physics evolved towards applications. She was a technology transfer professional and marketer at the University of Michigan where she worked with faculty and students from the College of Engineering to transform their research ideas into intellectual property. As a student of STS, she has published papers on how technology changed the lives of ancient people and she enjoys studying today’s  transformations.   

Her work experience includes stints at corporate venture at DTE Energy, equity research at Lehman Brothers, and sales forecasting for a leading video gaming and entertainment company. She has conducted due diligence across subject matter, e.g., acquisition of art objects using scientific tools, creation of intellectual property, and early stage investment. Dana is unique for quantitative and qualitative research training. Not only is she versed in statistics but also semi-structured interviews, ethnographic field study, and archival research. 

Dana has a B.A. in chemistry with highest honors from Oberlin College, a MBA with high distinction from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. from Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. Her interdisciplinary dissertation research was funded by the NSF and Kauffman Foundation via Stanford Law School.
