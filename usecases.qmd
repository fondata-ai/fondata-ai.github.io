## Forecasting

### Financial forecasting, investor relations 

Industry: Enterprise software

Client: CFO

Service:
Using corporate accounting data, Machine Learning forecasting models improved the accuracy and timeliness of financial forecasts used for quarterly stockholder reports, resulting in improved shareholder communications and increased opportunities for strategic planning.


### Forecasting and Budgeting consolidation in the Cloud

Industry: Telecommunications

Functional group: Finance & Budgeting, multinational corporation

Service:
Forecasting and budgeting by centralizing and consolidating data as a Cloud service across functional groups reduced headquarters and subsidiaries workload, resulted in cultural change, and expanded strategic options. 

### Real-time Auto-Scaling Deployment Decision

Industry: Cloud software

Client: Product Engineering

Service: 
Cloud service provider reported customer website failure under load. Provider asked whether or not to implement auto-scaling -- dynamic adjustment of computer resources based on predicted demand. Prediction models showed auto-scaling optimization had potential savings of $500K/year, but a decision analysis of alternatives showed the ROI did not justify auto-scaling. 

## Supply Chain

### Real-time stock management: Estimating resources on-hand to meet random “walk-in” demand

Industry: Fast food

Client – functional group: CTO 

Service: How many items should be ready-made? Too many - cold and wasted. Too few - lost revenue. Built a real time predition model that trades off lost revenue with cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit.   

### Sizing Seasonal Agricultural Product Shipping Requirements 

Industry: Freight Transportation Arrangement Industry 

Functional Group: Operations

Service: 

Forecasted customer demand by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used forecast to match suppliers with customers in ship provisioning, minimizing cost by reducing number of freight transportation vessels. 

### Durable goods yield management to free up inventory capacity

Industry: Consumer Electronics,  Computer Hardware

Functional Group: Finance & Accounting and Operations

Service: 
Revenue optimization by yield management. 
Generated models to estimate price elasticity of retail hardware that was used by client to set prices and quotas for existing stock resulting in reduction of inventory of older units, allowing room for new ones.

### Simulations of Electronic Health Records histories for Hospital management 

Industry: Healthcare

Functional group: Hospital Finance and Strategic Planning

Service: Estimating hospital capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends.


## Root-cause Analysis

### Semiconductor Fab Root cause fault analysis

Industry: Semiconductor manufacturing (fabrication plant)

Functional group: Lean Manufacturing Operations

Service: 
Piloted a causal model for ranking the source of equipment faults by their probability. Built an interactive intelligent diagnostic model that codified the knowledge of repair experts, resulting in reduced level of expertise needed. Novel AI approach for on-the-fly model adjustment and learning during diagnostic sessions. Pilot deployment reduced down time, reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput worth on the order of a few million dollars a year. 

### Diagnosing "OnTime and In Full" (OTIF) Failure Root Causes

Industry: Food service disposable and packaging, MNC

Functional Group: Corporate Accounting

Service: 
Production plant model to predict OTIF revealed that failures did _not_ originate in production.  Production scheduling was driven by avoiding shortages in output, resulting in excess inventory sitting in warehouses. Exploratory analyses discovered instead that the firm needed to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management.
