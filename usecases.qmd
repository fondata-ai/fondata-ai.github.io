## Forecasting Use Cases


### 1. Financial Forecasting, Investor Relations 

Industry: Enterprise Software

Functional Group: Corporate CFO

We improved the accuracy and timeliness of financial forecasts used in quarterly stockholder reports by developing machine machine learning forecasting models. Resulted in improved shareholder communications and, by increasing efficiency, allowed CFO to allocate more time to strategic planning.


### 2. Forecasting and Budgeting consolidation in the Cloud

Industry: Telecommunications

Functional group: Finance & Budgeting, multinational corporation

We moved forecasting and budgeting across functional groups to centralized data in the Cloud. Reduced overall workload and improved integration across subsidiaries. 

### 3. Real-time Auto-Scaling Deployment Decision

Industry: Cloud Software

Functional Group: Product Engineering

Cloud service provider presented a problem -- their customer website failed under load -- and asked whether what was needed was cluster autoscaling: implementing dynamic adjustment of computer resources based on predicted demand. Developed prediction models showing auto-scaling optimization offered potential savings to $500K/year. Client was advised _not_ to implement autoscaling after further analysis of other alternatives showed better ROI.

## Supply-Chain Use Cases

### 1. Real-time stock management: Estimating resources on-hand to meet random “walk-in” demand

Industry: Fast Food

Functional Group: CTO 

Client asked -- How many items should be ready-made in anticipation of customer demand? Too many -- goods will be cold and wasted. Too few -- lost revenue. We built the customer a real time prediction model that trades off lost revenue with the cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit.

### 2. Sizing Seasonal Agricultural Product Shipping Requirements 

Industry: Freight Transportation Cooperative 

Functional Group: Operations

We trained a model to forecast seasonal demand for agricultural products by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used this forecast to match suppliers with customers in shipment provisioning, maximizing utilization by reducing the number of freight transportation vessels. 

### 3. Durable goods yield management 

Industry: Consumer Electronics,  Computer Hardware

Functional Group: Finance & Accounting Operations

To improve yield management, we generated markdown pricing models by estimating product price elasticities. These were used by the client for yield management that trades off forecasted revenue with inventory holding opportunity costs of existing stock, freeing up inventory of older, deprecated units, to allow room for newer, more profitable models.

### 4. Simulation of Electronic Health Records histories for Hospital management 

Industry: Healthcare

Functional Group: Hospital Finance and Strategic Planning

We estimated hospital bed capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends. The model factored in demographics, predicted disease prevalence, and seasonal trends to improve health outcomes under hospital budget constraints.

## Root-cause Analysis Use Cases

### 1. Semiconductor Fab Root-cause Fault Analysis

Industry: Semiconductor manufacturing (fabrication plant)

Functional Group: Lean Manufacturing Operations

We piloted a causal model for ranking the root-causes of equipment faults by their probability. Built an interactive intelligent diagnostic model that codified the knowledge of repair experts, resulting in reduced level of expertise needed, using a novel AI approach for on-the-fly model adjustment and learning during diagnostic sessions. Pilot deployment reduced down time by reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput. Predicted revenue increase estimated to be a few million dollars per year.

### 2. Diagnosing "On Time and In Full" (OTIF) Failure Root-causes

Industry: Food service packaging, Multi-national Corporation

Functional Group: Corporate Accounting

We discovered actual sources of production inefficiencies for our client.  They had assumed production delays caused OTIF failures. We developed a model from existing production data to predict OTIF, which revealed, surprisingly that OTIF failures did _not_ originate in production.  Existing production scheduling was driven solely to avoid presumed delivery shortages, resulting in excess inventory sitting in warehouses. Based on this analyses we successfully identified the real inefficiency and advised the firm to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management.
