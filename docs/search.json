    "text": "This is related to setting up a custom domain for github pages. My published site was working fine, e.g. mysite-ai.github.io . I then configured my company domain, mysite.ai to point to my published site. I can no longer see my published site and the urls for both mysite.ai and mysite-ai.github.io timeout. Shouldn’t mysite-ai.github.io still be visible? WHen I go to mysite-ai.github.io repository -&gt; pages, it no longer shows that it is active. When I go to Actions, it shows that the last push deployed to mysite.ai. WHen I run dig I get this response\n;; ANSWER SECTION: mysite.ai. 600 IN A 185.199.110.153 mysite.ai. 600 IN A 185.199.11.153 mysite.ai. 600 IN A 15.197.142.173 mysite.ai. 600 IN A 3.33.152.147 mysite.ai. 600 IN A 185.199.108.153 mysite.ai. 600 IN A 185.199.109.153\nAt my DNS provider, I added an A record to get the above result, and a TXT record to be able to do verification. Domain verification for my github organization mysite-ai succeeds. The Pages tab under the repository mysite-ai.github.io does NOT show a domain. When I add mysite.ai as a custom domain I get :\nBoth mysite.ai and its alternate name are improperly configured Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server. For more information, see [documentation] (https://docs.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) (NotServedByPagesError).\nI cannot find the NotServedByPagesError info on the page mentioned above.\nWhen I visit the website I get an error\nYour connection is not private net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID\nWhen I click through the error I get a 404 There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here\nI’ve added an HTTP record that points to mysite-ai.github.io.\nAnyone know how to figure out what the solution is to get this site running?\n\nSolution:\n\nOnly the github organization needs to be verified. Also verifying fondata.ai from jmagosta (my personal account) under “pages” confuses github and forces periodic unverifing.\nA commit pull - push cycle is necessary to re-set the static github site (Error is a 404 from github)\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2025 Fondata, LLC."

Real-time stock management: Estimating resources on-hand to meet random “walk-in” demand\nIndustry: Fast Food\nFunctional Group: CTO\nClient asked – How many items should be ready-made in anticipation of customer demand? Too many – goods will be cold and wasted. Too few – lost revenue. We built the customer a real time prediction model that trades off lost revenue with the cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit.\n\n\n2. Sizing Seasonal Agricultural Product Shipping Requirements\nIndustry: Freight Transportation Cooperative\nFunctional Group: Operations\nWe trained a model to forecast seasonal demand for agricultural products by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used this forecast to match suppliers with customers in shipment provisioning, maximizing utilization by reducing the number of freight transportation vessels.\n\n\n3. Durable goods yield management\nIndustry: Consumer Electronics, Computer Hardware\nFunctional Group: Finance & Accounting Operations\nTo improve yield management, we generated markdown pricing models by estimating product price elasticities. These were used by the client for yield management that trades off forecasted revenue with inventory holding opportunity costs of existing stock, freeing up inventory of older, deprecated units, to allow room for newer, more profitable models.\n\n\n4. Simulation of Electronic Health Records histories for Hospital management\nIndustry: Healthcare\nFunctional Group: Hospital Finance and Strategic Planning\nWe estimated hospital bed capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends. The model factored in demographics, predicted disease prevalence, and seasonal trends to improve health outcomes under hospital budget constraints."

Semiconductor Fab Root-cause Fault Analysis\nIndustry: Semiconductor manufacturing (fabrication plant)\nFunctional Group: Lean Manufacturing Operations\nWe piloted a causal model for ranking the root-causes of equipment faults by their probability. Built an interactive intelligent diagnostic model that codified the knowledge of repair experts, resulting in reduced level of expertise needed, using a novel AI approach for on-the-fly model adjustment and learning during diagnostic sessions. Pilot deployment reduced down time by reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput. Predicted revenue increase estimated to be a few million dollars per year.\n\n\n2. Diagnosing “On Time and In Full” (OTIF) Failure Root-causes\nIndustry: Food service packaging, Multi-national Corporation\nFunctional Group: Corporate Accounting\nWe discovered actual sources of production inefficiencies for our client. They had assumed production delays caused OTIF failures. We developed a model from existing production data to predict OTIF, which revealed, surprisingly that OTIF failures did not originate in production. Existing production scheduling was driven solely to avoid presumed delivery shortages, resulting in excess inventory sitting in warehouses. Based on this analyses we successfully identified the real inefficiency and advised the firm to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management."
