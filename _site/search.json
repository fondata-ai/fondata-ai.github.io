Too many - cold and wasted. Too few - lost revenue. Built a real time predition model that trades off lost revenue with cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit.\n\n\nSizing Seasonal Agricultural Product Shipping Requirements\nIndustry: Freight Transportation Arrangement Industry\nFunctional Group: Operations\nService: Forecasted customer demand by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used forecast to match suppliers with customers in ship provisioning, maximizing utilization by reducing the number of freight transportation vessels.\n\n\nDurable goods yield management to free up inventory capacity\nIndustry: Consumer Electronics, Computer Hardware\nFunctional Group: Finance & Accounting Operations\nService: Revenue optimization by yield management to optimize inventory turnover. Generated “markdown” models to estimate price elasticity of retail hardware that was used by client to set prices and quotas for existing stock resulting in reduction of inventory of older units, allowing room for new ones.\n\n\nSimulations of Electronic Health Records histories for Hospital management\nIndustry: Healthcare\nFunctional Group: Hospital Finance and Strategic Planning\nService: Estimating hospital bed capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends. Factored in demographics, predicted disease prevalence and seasonal trends."

    "text": "Root-cause Analysis Use Cases\n\nSemiconductor Fab Root cause fault analysis\nIndustry: Semiconductor manufacturing (fabrication plant)\nFunctional Group: Lean Manufacturing Operations\nService: Piloted a causal model for ranking the source of equipment faults by their probability. Built an interactive intelligent diagnostic model that codified the knowledge of repair experts, resulting in reduced level of expertise needed. Novel AI approach for on-the-fly model adjustment and learning during diagnostic sessions. Pilot deployment reduced down time, reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput worth on the order of a few million dollars incremental revenue per year.\n\n\nDiagnosing “OnTime and In Full” (OTIF) Failure Root Causes\nIndustry: Food service disposable and packaging, MNC\nFunctional Group: Corporate Accounting\nService: Developed a model from existing production data to predict OTIF that revealed that OTIF failures did not originate in production. Existing production scheduling was driven to avoid presumed shortages in output, resulting in excess inventory sitting in warehouses. Based on exploratory analyses advised the firm to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management."
