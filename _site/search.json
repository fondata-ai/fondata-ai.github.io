Built a real time predition model that trades off lost revenue with cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit.\n\n\nSizing Seasonal Agricultural Product Shipping Requirements\nIndustry: Freight Transportation Arrangement Industry\nFunctional Group: Operations\nService:\nForecasted customer demand by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used forecast to match suppliers with customers in ship provisioning, minimizing cost by reducing number of freight transportation vessels.\n\n\nDurable goods yield management to free up inventory capacity\nIndustry: Consumer Electronics, Computer Hardware\nFunctional Group: Finance & Accounting and Operations\nService: Revenue optimization by yield management. Generated models to estimate price elasticity of retail hardware that was used by client to set prices and quotas for existing stock resulting in reduction of inventory of older units, allowing room for new ones.\n\n\nSimulations of Electronic Health Records histories for Hospital management\nIndustry: Healthcare\nFunctional group: Hospital Finance and Strategic Planning\nService: Estimating hospital capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends."

Built an interactive intelligent diagnostic model that codified the knowledge of repair experts, resulting in reduced level of expertise needed. Novel AI approach for on-the-fly model adjustment and learning during diagnostic sessions. Pilot deployment reduced down time, reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput worth on the order of a few million dollars a year.\n\n\nDiagnosing “OnTime and In Full” (OTIF) Failure Root Causes\nIndustry: Food service disposable and packaging, MNC\nFunctional Group: Corporate Accounting\nService: Production plant model to predict OTIF revealed that failures did not originate in production. Production scheduling was driven by avoiding shortages in output, resulting in excess inventory sitting in warehouses. Exploratory analyses discovered instead that the firm needed to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management."
