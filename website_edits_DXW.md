Remove "Welcome"
"your" in "your business strategy and processes" (right side bar)

Change "Our services:" to "Our services"
Change "Our experience includes" to "Our Experience"
Change "Work with us before you commit to a major cloud deployment" to "Work with us before committing to cloud deployment"
About the latter, explain why.

I don't understand grammar behind "anchored by its data." what does it modify?

A/B testing is an experiment, hypothesis testing, less so a statistical model.

Under Services. Many long winded run on sentences.
Need to copy the structure of this one in others: "Service: Forecasted customer demand by analyzing historical data on freight category, destination, and quantity. Client used forecast to match suppliers with customers in ship provisioning, maximizing utilization by reducing the number of freight transportation vessels."



From: "Using corporate accounting data, Machine Learning forecasting models improved the accuracy and timeliness of financial forecasts used for quarterly stockholder reports by devel resulting in improved shareholder communications and more time for strategic planning.


*TO: "Improved the accuracy and timeliness of financial forecasts used in quarterly stockholder repo shareholder communications and by increasing efficiency, allowed CFO to allocate more time to strategic planning.rts by developing machine machine learning forecasting models. Resulted in improved"

From: "Forecasting and budgeting by centralizing and consolidating data as a Cloud service across functional groups reduced overall workload, by improving integration across subsidiaries."


*TO: "Moved forecasting and budgeting across functional groups to centralized data in the Cloud. Reduced overall workload and improved integration across subsidiaries."

From: "Cloud service provider reported customer website failure under load. Provider asked whether or not to implement auto-scaling – dynamic adjustment of computer resources based on predicted demand. Prediction models showed auto-scaling optimization had potential savings of $500K/year, but a decision analysis of alternatives showed the ROI did not justify auto-scaling."

*To: "Cloud service provider presented problem - customer website failure under load -- and asked whether to implement auto-scaling - dynamic adjustment of computer resources based on predicted demand. Developed prediction models showing auto-scaling optimization offered potential savings to $500K/year. However, provider decided not to implement after analysis of alternatives, showing ROI did not justify auto-scaling."


Is that right, the cloud service provider turned down the solution? or was it the client?

-----
FROM: "How many items should be ready-made? Too many - cold and wasted. Too few - lost revenue. Built a real time predition model that trades off lost revenue with cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit."

*TO: "Client asked -- How many items should be ready-made? Too many - cold and wasted. Too few - lost revenue. Built a real time prediction model that trades off lost revenue with cost of discarded goods, to maximize profit."

-----
FROM: "Revenue optimization by yield management to optimize inventory turnover. Generated “markdown” models to estimate price elasticity of retail hardware that was used by client to set prices and quotas for existing stock resulting in reduction of inventory of older units, allowing room for new ones."

*TO:...Which one took precedence, revenue optimization or inventory turnover?

----
FROM: Estimating hospital bed capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends. Factored in demographics, predicted disease prevalence and seasonal trends.

*TO:  Estimated hospital bed capacity needs, e.g. number of hospital beds, by detailed simulation of population health trends. Factored in demographics, predicted disease prevalence and seasonal trends. WHAT WAS END RESULT?

---
FROM: "....  Pilot deployment reduced down time, reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput worth on the order of a few million dollars incremental revenue per year."

*TO: "Pilot deployment reduced down time by reducing bottlenecks, and increasing throughput. Increased revenue by a few million dollars per year."


Service: Identified underlying problem not identified by client. Client assumed OTIF failures originated in production. Developed a model from existing production data to predict OTIF that indicated otherwise. Problem was excessive inventory sitting in warehouses to avoid presumed (PREDICTED?)  shortages in output. Based on exploratory analyses, advised the firm to adopt JIT (Just-In-Time manufacturing) to optimize inventory management." AND WHAT HAPPENED?

----
FROM: "He’s held positions at SRI International, Toyota ITC, and Intel Research, interspersed with stints at several startups, during which he’s written over 30 peer-reviewed publications and 6 accepted patents."



"He’s held positions at SRI International, Toyota ITC, and Intel Research, interspersed with stints at several startups. John has written over 30 peer-reviewed publications and is an inventor listed on 6 U.S. patents."
